           <p>
            This semester went by way too fast. I find it so hard to grasp that just a few weeks ago I was pressing the submit button for my dissertation! It still has not hit me that unless I pursue a Master’s degree, that might be the last academic document that I ever write. 


           </p>

           <p>
            My dissertation is something that I am extremely proud of: it was my very first time writing a critical journal, and I tried very hard to put across my findings and explorations in a language and tone that were understandable yet sophisticated. I hope to extend it after we graduate and work on it till it has reached a point good enough for publication, perhaps. 


           </p>

            As for my Graduation Project itself, I would be lying to myself if I said I was a 100% happy with where it is now. I think, looking back at my CPJ and through any notes I had, I saw so many missed opportunities that I could have explored- for instance, something much more culturally steeped (had I found the right angle) or something much larger in scale. I think my time management and also personal frustrations and solving some coding-related problems contributed to that. The weeks in between were riddled with some personal and family-related issues, plus a whole trip to Japan, and perhaps my focus was not 100% there. 

           </p>

            A recurring topic of conversation amongst our friend group is: if you could go back to week 1, semester 1, would you change your research topic? 

           </p>

           <p>
            My initial answer was going to be ‘maybe’: I think it would have been really cool to explore something related to generative identities in graphic design, but on further thought, I realised I would not have pushed myself enough, and learnt anything drastically new, and that is a potential project I can explore in my own time. 

           </p>

With this project, I really understood how to work with physical computing in tandem with JavaScript and Python, or in essence, how different software can work together. I feel much more confident with coding-related issues (and how to troubleshoot them) and I feel excited at the prospect of continuing to use my Arduino and huge collection of little itty bitty parts to make something. I think I can definitely improve on aspects like cable management, appearance, presentation and in general long-term functionality, but I feel as if this project has allowed me to build a solid foundation.

            As for my love for plants, I see them as each having their own distinct personalities. I’ve brought them back from studio and arranged them in my room (it’s almost a jungle in here now). Looking back at pictures of them from last semester when they were tiny small babies versus looking at them now- perhaps I understand to some extent what a parent might feel.

           </p>

           <p>
            Am I done with this project? No, I think I see loose threads that still need to be tied up and potential further experimentation that can take place slowly and without the constraints of a deadline. I can factor in how growth and decay can really affect how Human-Plant interactions can take place. I’m not ready to let it go, and I want to take my time and rediscover the passion that I started this project with, in the first place!

           </p>


           <p>
            Before I sign off, I’d really like to thank my lecturer, Andreas, who saw all the ups and downs and (not really, I’m just super fidgety) impatience and frustration throughout all these weeks. I really appreciate your guidance and also your resourcefulness! 


           </p>

           <p>
            And lastly, to all my studio friends that I spent probably 90% of my time this year with: you know how much you mean to me, and I hope we get to do this together again.
           </p>

           <p>
            Warm regards, <br>Aditi.
