                Good news! I heard back from Christa Sommerer, which I was not expecting at all!

                I spent some time thinking about what I'd like to ask her. Andreas advised that I keep the questions to a maximum of 5-6, so I took some time to study Interactive Plant Growing once again and formulated the following questions:

                1. Can try to utilise using other plant-related characteristics like flowers and even fruits as sites for touch-based tangible input
            </p>
