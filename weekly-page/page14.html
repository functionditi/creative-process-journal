            <p>
                I guess my main problem is the fact that my primary sensor, the 1M resistor as a capacitive sensor, is so low fidelity that it captures a lot of external noise and is just not reliable all the time. For instance, it worked perfectly at my desk but when I took my contraption to show Andreas it was so janky!

            <p>
                I did some research to try and see if I could eliminate some of that noise and I came across <a href="https://github.com/Lessnullvoid/Pulsum-Plantae" target="_blank" class="callout">Pulsum Plantae,</a> which seems to be a custom-made PCB with the LM324N at its core, which is a ‘Quad-Operational Amplifier’. I don’t totally understand what it does and how it works at the moment, and I don’t think I can figure it out this week. So, using this amplifier is a goal of mine in December: maybe I can create my own sensors (like i have been doing so far) but just much more effective and less noisy.

            </p>

            <p>
                Apart from the noisiness of the resistor, I am also just so dead set on this one ‘touch-plant’ to ‘make-light-glow’ framework that I’m not playing with more interesting possibilities. There are so many more ways to actuate plant responses, like using serial connections to p5 (like I did before, successfully!) and creating cool animations, or even using the Axidraw, so why am I confining myself here?
            </p>
            
            <p>
                On second thought, though, as I was building my repository website, I realised so many pre-existing Living Media Interfaces use screens as a method of output. That got me thinking: what new and valuable contribution would I be making, if this paradigm is already something covered? Something to think about.
