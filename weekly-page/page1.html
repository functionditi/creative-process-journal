                This is my first time back in studio after spending a semester abroad. My current headspace is working within computational design, and my compendium dived into examining cybernatures (interactive and immersive installations that feature artificial life) to comprehend our current relationship with nature and how we view the ecosystems around us.
            </p>

            <p>
                Looking at my compendium three months later, I can very clearly see that it was visibly rushed and not well-designed.

                I can also point out inherent problems with the question I was asking, and I did not define any scope: when I referrred to ‘nature’, which such an all-encompassing topic, without whittling it down, I ended up grappling with many concepts all at once and generalised a lot. In reality, the way people define what nature is really depends on culture and varies tremendously and holds a lot of nuance which I definitely ignored.

            </p>

            <p>
                I tend to overcomplicate things on first try and last semester, since I was on exchange, I didn’t have consultations and essentially submitted what should have been a first draft. It was over ambitious and lacked clarity, and that’s something I hope to revisit and re-approach this year.
