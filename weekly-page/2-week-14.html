              New (last minute) Direction!
            </h5>

            <p>
              Last week I decided to order some RGB TFT screens from Shopee to use as a means of hosting the visual output or visual language. I think my main gripe with using a projector is the portability and the huge constraints, but I did like that they brought the visual output to the same spatial area of the tangible input. 

            </p>

            <p>
              These screens came this week which was great. I did have to solder them together but I think I will definitely implement this for my second prototype: I like their size, I like how intimate it seems, and lastly, I think they can sort of integrate themselves with the plant in a potentially successful manner!
            </p>


            <p>
              First, let's figure out how to incorporate these screens into the form of the plant and pot.
            </p>


            <div style="display: grid; grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr); column-gap: 1rem; ">

            <h5>Visual Language</h5>

            <p>
              I also thought a bit more about the visual language. Last week, I was going to use the roots as a potential visual language, by using projections as a medium. I think I can definitely build on that idea of using something that is relevant to the plants themselves as an official language: just like I used roots (because plants communicate via the rhizome.) I decided to revisit the aspect of cellular automaton that I explored last semester.
            </p>

            <p>

I think the rationale for using cellular automata as a visual language is quite legitimate because itâ€™s an algorithm that is applied in computer science and engineering, but also appears and occurs naturally in nature. The patterns are visually appealing and they also have a certain level of complexity that can be adjusted according to different plant inputs.

            </p>

          <h5>Cable Management</h5>
          <p>
            Man, they should turn cable management into a degree itself. 
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, each RGB TFT had 6 pins, and I had 3 TFT screens, which meant 18 separate wires to deal with!  If I let the wires fly loose, I would end up with a prototype that looked 90% wires and tech and 10% plant, which was not ideal. I needed to soften and neaten the addition of the TFT screens because otherwise they would be extremely intrusive.

          I'd like to say I worked pretty fast and was super efficient, but I think it was mainly the sense of urgency that was driving me.

        <h5>Catalogue of Making Revamp, and Art Direction</h5>

        <p>
          I decided to change my art direction slightly because I felt the previous typeface I was using, Formula, was not the most appropriate for the project: it had a little too much character. The stretched type also was gimmicky.
        </p>

        <p>
          I decided to go with using an Indian typeface: Weissenhoff Grotesk, which was smooth and rounded while also being quite present and condfident.

          <br>

          <p>
            I decided to redo my layouts slightly as well, introducing a gradient background to help provide some sense of stability to the composition.

          <h5>Final Reflections</h5>

          <p>
            I have one week left and so much to do that at this point I have turned into a machine that only executes. Maybe that's a good thing? Sometimes I overthink things and waste time.
          </p>

          <p>
            Currently, I am quite happy with the prototype because it seems to be quite functional and looks sleek. I think it's simple yet shows complexity and diversity in visual output, which for me, is ideal. However, I am missing solid documentation and I have yet to make a video about how it would be used, so I booked a photography studio at Winsteadt to take some photos and videos.
